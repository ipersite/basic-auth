A program to give basic authentication based on file and (maybe in the future) database queries. In particular it is written for Squid Proxy.

Now it has the capability to parse configuration file that contains the path of log files and the credentials file path, in order to give a file-based authentication.
Install script doesn't copy any configuration file for now, but you can check the sintax by opening them. Easy, not? (you can find the in the "conf" directory).

TODO:
* Configurator class to parse configuration file (almost done)
* Add support for MySQL database (maybe in the future)
